This is a Firefox addon to create a table of contents to any website I visit.

You can easily install it from [the Mozilla Addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/hu/firefox/addon/table-of-contents/)

It adds a small icon in your addons bar, and you can toggle the ToC by clicking on it.

Kudos goes to jgallen23 for his very nice [toc.js](https://github.com/jgallen23/toc) jquery plugin.
